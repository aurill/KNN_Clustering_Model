# Project Title: Caribbean Country Clustering

## Overview
Welcome to the Caribbean Country Clustering project! This repository encapsulates a thorough exploration of thirteen sovereign island nations in the Caribbean, employing advanced data analytics to unveil distinctive patterns based on key metrics: Population, Land Size, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Crime Rate. Exclusively focusing on sovereign entities, this project delves into the economic and social dynamics that uniquely shape each country.

## Methodology of Data Collection
Our commitment to data integrity drives a comprehensive methodology. Information is meticulously sourced from reputable databases, international organizations, and academic research. Population data, a cornerstone of our analysis, is cross-verified using the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Britannica Encyclopedia. GDP, with a special focus on Cuba, draws from The Economist Intelligence Unit, ensuring a nuanced economic perspective. Crime Rate data, gathered from the World Population Review and NUMBEO, navigates the challenge of limited data through the strategic use of proxy variables.

## Data Analysis
Our data analysis journey involves meticulous processing and verification. Real GDP calculations, incorporating inflation rates, add a layer of depth to economic insights. The clustering process is executed in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The elbow method and silhouette score guide the determination of optimal clusters, culminating in a visually striking 3D scatter plot.

## Clusters and Insights
Unveiling the clusters based on Population, Land Size, GDP, and Crime Rate offers captivating insights into the economic and social fabric of the Caribbean countries. Discover correlations between land size and GDP, observe the impact of population density on crime rates, and explore the distinctive position of Cuba within the clusters. Our findings present a nuanced understanding of the diverse characteristics that define each cluster.

## Code Structure
The Python code in this repository is a testament to our commitment to transparency and accessibility. Well-documented and structured, it includes functions for loading data, preprocessing, and employing the KMeans algorithm for clustering. Visualizations, such as the elbow method and silhouette score graphs, add clarity to the intricacies of the clustering process.

## Cluster Descriptions
Dive into detailed descriptions of each cluster, offering a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between land size, population, GDP, and crime rates. Our 3D scatter plot visually encapsulates these intricate relationships, providing a holistic overview of the clustering results.
